# 🚀 ARCore Model Placement App

A feature-rich **ARCore-based Android application** that allows users to seamlessly place and interact with 3D models in the real world. This app demonstrates modern augmented reality capabilities using Google's ARCore and Sceneform, delivering an immersive user experience with smooth animations, intuitive controls, and real-world model anchoring.

## 📌 Key Features

### 🧊 1. Load and Display 3D GLB Model in AR
The app supports **GLB model rendering** using modern Sceneform capabilities. On app launch, a high-quality 3D model is asynchronously loaded into memory, optimized for AR rendering.

### 👆 2. Tap to Place Model on Detected Horizontal Plane
Users can simply **tap anywhere on a detected surface** to place the model at that exact location. The app uses screen touch gestures to map user intent into the physical environment.

### 🌐 3. Real-Time Plane Detection using ARCore
ARCore’s powerful tracking system detects **horizontal surfaces** in real-time. The app visually overlays the plane to guide users where placement is possible.

### 📍 4. Anchor Model to the Real World Surface
Once placed, the model is **anchored to the real-world plane**, ensuring it remains fixed even as the user moves around — offering a realistic spatial experience.

### 🎛️ 5. Toggle Plane Renderer Visibility
After placing the model, the **plane renderer can be hidden** to clean up the visual interface and enhance realism. This improves the immersive feel once interaction is complete.

### 🔙 6. Back Button Navigation
A simple **back button** is integrated to allow users to easily return to the previous screen or activity, improving user navigation and experience.

### 🎞️ 7. Automatic Model Animation
The 3D model supports **auto-play animation**, providing life-like motion and dynamic interaction. Animation starts as soon as the model is placed.

### 📸 8. Camera Permission Handling
The app intelligently requests and handles **camera permissions** required for AR functionality. If permissions are denied, the user is prompted with clear instructions to enable them.
